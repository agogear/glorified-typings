The tutorial material from the SOEN344 w2011 class, which I TA'ed. Originally published on `richard.jp.leguen.ca/not-blog/about-servlets-and-jsps/` and `richard.jp.leguen.ca/not-blog/about-jsps/`.

I only ever wrote two tutorials for the Winter 2011 SOEN344 class - one [about Servlets](tut-01.about-servlets-and-jsps.md) and one [about JSPs](tut-02.about-jsps.md) - which were both published on my personal website's blog.
